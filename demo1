you did a great job but we are not using any as a type interace in our code 

for your better understanding the type of the data input will be NetworkConnectionsInfo[]

type NetworkConnectionsInfo = {
  name: string;
  status: boolean;
  underLyingDevice: string;
  connectionType: string | undefined;
  macAddress: string;
  ipv4Address: string;
  subnetMask: string;
  ipv4DefaultGateway: string;
  ipv4DnsAddress_1: string;
  ipv4DnsAddress_2: string;
  ipv4AddressDist: DhcpEnabled;
  ipv6Prefix: string;
  ipv6Address: string;
  ipv6LinkLocalAddress: string;
  ipv6DnsAddress_1: string;
  ipv6DnsAddress_2: string;
  ipv6AddressDist: Ipv6ServiceType;
  recvPackets: number;
  sendPackets: number;
  recvBytes: number;
  sendBytes: number;
  recvErrors: number;
  recvDrops: number;
  timeSpan: Dayjs;
};

and you should also give the output to be of the type constructed from the above type

That was good and is working fine 
now we need to add more validations to that 
create a sepreate function for each validations case 
first create them in the proper array format like for (number|[number,number]) format 
for example if there is 233,424-453,4532,2341,31-43,453,21-24 then it should come 
[233,[424,453],4532,2341,[31,43],453,[21,24]] and so on 

now for the case 1: if there is any array for example here we have [424,453] and start port is greater than or equal to  the end port then we need to return false 

case 2: if the port 4567 comes in the middle of the above ports then we need to return false 

case 3: if the port 4577 comes in the middle of the ports we need to return false

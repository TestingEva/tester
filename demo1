great its working fine as usual 

now i just want to create a new validations for checking whether some port are overlapping 

for example if we input [ 4567, [ 244, 254 ], [ 457, 4566 ], 21 ,251]

then we see that 251 already comes in the range of [244,254] so you need to return this array 

and suppose our input was [ 456, [ 244, 254 ], [ 457, 4566 ], 456 ] then you should return the number 456 

suppose our entry was valid no port overlapping then return true

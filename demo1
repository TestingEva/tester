Hi I have a modal named export type ParentalRuleModel = {
  scheduleType: "Always" | "User defined";
  selectedCondition: "Select" | boolean;
  selectedDevice: "Select" | "User defined";
} & CreateParentalRule


type CreateParentalRule = {
    enabled: boolean;
    name: string;
    devices: Ipv4DeviceInfo[];
    schedule: ScheduleInfo[];
    websiteExceptions: string[];
    keywordExceptions: string[];
    internetAccessible: boolean;
}


also i have a utility function which gives me the changed Values from the state

the function will return Partial<ParentalRuleModel> for the feilds which have changed 

now i want to check wether there is change in the currentState but the problem is that whenever there is some change in the scheduleType or selectedCondtion or selectedDEvices or any other params its getting recorded but i want to ignore the check for them in Object 

const isApplyButtonEnabled = useMemo(() => {
    if (object.keys(changedValue).length===0) {
      return false;
    }

    return true;
  }, [currentState, changedValues]);

here is the code 

whenever schedule type or selectedCondition or selectedDEveices are present in the object the condition fails my statement

In my next role, I'm looking for a position that lets me work across both front-end and back-end development, giving me the opportunity to fully utilize my skills as a full-stack developer. I’m especially interested in roles where I can dive into complex challenges, from creating seamless, user-friendly front-end experiences with React and TypeScript to building robust, scalable back-end systems. I’d love to join a team that values quality code, performance optimization, and a collaborative, agile environment. I’m looking for a role where I can continue growing my expertise, contribute to impactful projects, and work alongside a talented team to build innovative, high-performance applications end-to-end.

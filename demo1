Like for the logging I have new requirements 
Like we what i was told is to create a seperate file in which i will be having a array and the it would be having 
the following format 
[
    info:{
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
    },
    Debug:{
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
    },
    warn:{
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
    },
    error:{
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
        [timestamp, level, tag , message],
    }
]

there will be a function which will be used to update the array from throughout the application 
it will accept level,tag,message  Where tags are custom strings used for grouping similar log events and level is {info,debug,warn,error}
and it will append the logs inside the apporpriate group 
and when the info Logs length is equal to 10 it will call an API using fetch and it will send the Logs 
Could you design the above function

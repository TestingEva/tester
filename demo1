so i got ipAddress and subnet mask and i need you to perform validations on valid ipRange

so i got two input fields which have input for start ip address and end ipAddress and i want 
you to check for the following validations

The number of IP Addresses in the DHCP IP address range must not be more than 256.
Start IP Address, End IP Address: The DHCP IP address range does not conform to the connection IP address and the DHCP subnet mask.
End IP Address: The DHCP IP address range does not conform to the connection IP address and the DHCP subnet mask.

write a typescript function which accepts ipAddress, subnet mask , startIpAddress ,end ipAddress and return a string array with the 
respective error messsages mentioned above 

if everything is valid return empty string array []

suppose this the format of the date i am reciviing and i want you to calculate the difference as done in the function below 

const timeRemaining = (val) => {
        const timeLeft = Math.round((Date.parse(val) - timestamp) / 1000);
        return timeLeft <= 0 ? "Expired" : timeLeft;
    }




I want you to use Dayjs to calculate the difference and the output should in the same unit as done in the above function

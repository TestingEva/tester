Got it
export type PortForwardingProfileInfo = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  originalPorts: (number | [number, number])[];
  protocol: PortForwardingProtocol;
  hostName?: string;
  hostIpAddress: IPv4;
  forwardPort: number;
  schedule: "Always" | PinholeSchedule;
  enabled: boolean;
}[];

This is the portForwardingInfo I am having and now i need you to create a typescript function which will take the above array and  ports: (number | [number, number])[]
and perform the validations which is required

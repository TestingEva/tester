Subject: Clarification Regarding Mohit's Withdrawal

Hi Karthik,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to address the recent news regarding Mohit's decision to withdraw from the Software Engineer position.

I wanted to clarify that I was not aware of Mohit's decision to accept another offer and withdraw from the position at Global Logic. This move was unexpected, and I learned about it only after they had communicated their decision to the HR team.

I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience or disruption this may have caused. I had high hopes for Mohit's contribution to our team and believed they would have been a valuable addition to the organization.

Please let me know if there is anything I can do to assist in the transition or in finding a suitable replacement. I remain committed to supporting Global Logic and ensuring a smooth recruitment process.

Thank you for your understanding.

Best regards,

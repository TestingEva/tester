Conflicting Port Forwarding Rules: The Destination Port 244 conflicts with an existing port in the current rule.

you are returning the above message but i want you to return the range or port in which the conflict occured 
for example my input was [ 4567, [ 244, 254 ], [ 457, 4566 ], 21 ]  and if there was 21 already being used then you should return 21 as its the port in the array given 

suppose 247 was already being used the you should return [244,254] the full port range and if it is valid then return true 

so the function can now return true or a number or a port range ie [number,number]

Conversion of type 'typeof factory' to type 'Mock<any, any>' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type 'typeof factory' is missing the following properties from type 'Mock<any, any>': getMockName, mock, mockClear, mockReset

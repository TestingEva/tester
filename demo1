your case 1 did well but for case 2 and 3 you could not did well 

[ 233, [ 12, 231 ], [ 457, 4568 ], 21 ]

for this entry it returns true but 4567 is in the range 457-4568

the array which i am giving you the entry is a Port array in which 233 ,21 are the individal ports and 12-231 are the port ranges 
now you need to find whether 4577 or 4567 are present in the this array

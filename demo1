In my next role, I seek to leverage my front-end and back-end expertise to build seamless, high-performance applications. I'm excited to work in a collaborative, agile environment where I can tackle complex challenges, optimize performance, and contribute to impactful projects across the full stack.

I’m Sushant Mishra, currently working as an Associate Software Engineer at GlobalLogic, where I’ve been involved in projects with top clients like Verizon. I specialize in front-end development using TypeScript, React, and state management libraries. I've improved app performance and code maintainability by transitioning architectures and optimizing builds. I also have experience in full-stack projects and agile practices, ensuring efficient development and high-quality code. I enjoy solving complex problems and building scalable, user-friendly applications.

HI I want to create a search component and I have the following hook 


export type QuerySuggestionResult = {
  suggestQueries: (query: string) => void;
  suggestions: string[];
  currentSuggestion?: string;
  nextSuggestion: () => void;
  prevSuggestion: () => void;
};

export function useQuerySuggestions(): QuerySuggestionResult {
  const { data: searchProvider } = useSearchProvider();
  const [currentSuggestion, setCurrentSuggestion] = useState<string | undefined>(undefined);
  const [suggestions, setSuggestions] = useState<string[]>([]);
  const [currentIndex, setCurrentIndex] = useState(0);

  const suggestQueries = useCallback(
    (query: string) => {
      if (searchProvider !== undefined) {
        setSuggestions(searchProvider.suggestQueries(query));
      }
    },
    //eslint-disable-next-line
    [searchProvider]
  );

  const nextSuggestion = useCallback(() => {
    if (currentIndex < suggestions.length - 1) {
      const nextIndex = currentIndex + 1;
      setCurrentIndex(nextIndex);
      setCurrentSuggestion(suggestions[nextIndex]);
    }
  }, [currentIndex, suggestions]);

  const prevSuggestion = useCallback(() => {
    if (currentIndex > 0) {
      const prevIndex = currentIndex - 1;
      setCurrentIndex(prevIndex);
      setCurrentSuggestion(suggestions[prevIndex]);
    }
  }, [currentIndex, suggestions]);

  return {
    suggestQueries,
    suggestions,
    currentSuggestion,
    nextSuggestion,
    prevSuggestion,
  };
}


So there must be input where We have option to auto complete and also if we have more than one suggestions currentSuggestion should be shown and suggestions will be shown in the dropdown also 
when the user press up the prevSuggestion will be called and down then nextSuggestion will be called 

when this functions are called currentSuggestion will change


now Suppose usertypes "set a p" then the currentSuggestion will be having "assword" and when user press tab it should say set a password 

also the suggestion text should be grayed out 

we are using Styled components and React-bootstrap 

Also there should be modal (bootstrap) having a text field where we can search

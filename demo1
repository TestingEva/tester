Conversion of type '{ enabled: boolean; name: string; portFwdRange: number[]; portTriggerId: string; portTriggerRange: number[]; protocol: string; scheduleId: string; }[]' to type 'PortTriggeringData[]' may be a mistake because neither type sufficiently overlaps with the other. If this was intentional, convert the expression to 'unknown' first.
  Type '{ enabled: boolean; name: string; portFwdRange: number[]; portTriggerId: string; portTriggerRange: number[]; protocol: string; scheduleId: string; }' is not comparable to type 'PortTriggeringData'.
    Types of property 'portFwdRange' are incompatible.
      Type 'number[]' is not comparable to type '[number, number]'.
        Target requires 2 element(s) but source may have fewer.

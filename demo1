Hi 
I need your help in developing a function called as zodCatcher

This function will take schema and default value and will assign the default value if there is some schema failure 

For example, 

export const UpnpResponseSchema = z.object({
  enabled: z.boolean(),
  autoCleanEnabled: z.boolean(),
});

Suppose i have the above schema

export const UpnpResponseSchema = z.object({
  enabled: zodCatcher(z.boolean(),true),
  autoCleanEnabled: zodCatcher(z.boolean(),true),
});

This is just a example make it such that it can take a generic type and do the thinfs

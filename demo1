Subject: Request for Work from Home and Leave on 13th November

Dear Srikamal,

I am writing to request work-from-home arrangements for the next month due to a medical situation with my father. He has been diagnosed with anemia and requires regular visits to the doctor, as well as ongoing care at home. Given these circumstances, I would like to ensure he receives the necessary support during his treatment.

Additionally, I request leave on the 13th of November to accompany him to an important consultation.

I appreciate your understanding and consideration, and I am committed to maintaining productivity and timely communication while working remotely. Please let me know if further details are required.

Thank you for your support.

Best regards,
Sushant
